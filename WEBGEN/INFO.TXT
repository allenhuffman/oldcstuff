My former project is the WebVenture Generator

It allows easy creation of virtual "tour" HTML pages.  All you have to
do is provide image files, an .html template, and a map file and it does
the rest.

Suppose you have a five location "area" such as this:

       [ 1 ] --- [ 2 ]
         |         |
       [ 3 ] --- [ 4 ] --- [ 5 ]

Each room will require four image files, one for each direction you can be
facing.  All files used will contain the same "root" name, such as "GAME_".
The image files would therefore end up being called:

        GAME_01N.JPG - image for room 1 when facing North
        GAME_01S.JPG - image for room 1 when facing South
        GAME_01W.JPG - image for room 1 when facing West
        GAME_01E.JPG - image for room 1 when facing East

A map file is also required which shows how the rooms are connected.  The
lines of the file contain the room number you would be in if you went in
the corresponding direction.  0 means there is no room in that direction.

        GAME_.MAP file:
	*
	* This is a sample .map file
	* (Formate: "n,s,w,e")
	*
        0,3,0,2	* room 1, East goes to room 2, South goes to room 3
        0,4,1,0	* room 2, South goes to Room 4, West goes to room 1
        1,0,0,4	* room 3, North goes to room 1, East goes to room 4
        2,0,3,5	* room 4, North goes to 2, East goes to 5, West goes to 3
        0,0,4,0	* room 5, West goes to room 4

The map file can also now contain "overrides" which specify alternate image
files for each room direction, as well as room description text.  A sample
might look like this:

	*
	1,2,3,4	* Room direction data
		IMAGES=door,wall,wall,wall
		DESC=You are in a room with a door on the North wall.
	*

In this example, when facing North, the image file "door" would be shown.
All other directions would show the "wall" image file.  This allows you
to have "generic" images used rather than requiring actual distinct
images for each location and each direction.

Finally, there is a template HTML file required which will be used to
generate all the new files.  You make a standard HTML file but include
certain "keywords" which will be replaced by the appropriate code in the
new pages.  For example:

        IMAGE - gets replaced by the image name for the current room
        FACING - inserts direction you are facing for that room ("North")
        DESCRIPTION - puts in a special room description from the map file
        MOVEL - the html page for the room left of where you are
        MOVER - the html page for the room right of where you are
        FORWARD - the html page for the room in front of you
        BACK - the html page for the room behind you
        TURNLEFT - the html page for the same room, but facing to the left
        TURNRIGHT - the html page for the same room, but facing to the right
        TURNAROUND - the html page for the same room, but facing behind you

The program will omit any line containing a keyword that doesn't apply.
For example, if the current location has no "room" in front of it (i.e., you
cannot move FORWARD), it won't put the line with that keyword in the
output file.  For this reason it is important to ensure that all keyword
lines which may be omitted in this manner contain NO OTHER html code that
will need to be there.  Consider this example:

        <html>
        <img src=IMAGE.jpg>
        <a href=FORWARD.htm> Click here to move Forward </a>
        <a href=BACK.htm> Click here to move Back </a>
        <a href=MOVEL.htm> Click here to Move Left </a>
        <a href=MOVER.htm> Click here to Move Right </a>
        <a href=TURNLEFT.htm> Click here to Turn Left </a>
        <a href=TURNRIGHT.htm> Click here to Turn Right </a>
        <a href=TURNAROUND.htm> Click here to Turn Around </a>
        </html>

This might produce the following code for Room 1 of this "area":

        <html>
        <img src=GAME_01N.jpg>
            *** this line omitted since there is no room FORWARD from here ***
        <a href=GAME_03N.htm> Click here to move Back </a>
            *** this line omitted since there is no room LEFT from here ***
        <a href=GAME_02N.htm> Click here to Move Right </a>
        <a href=GAME_01W.htm> Click here to Turn Left </a>
        <a href=GAME_01E.htm> Click here to Turn Right </a>
        <a href=GAME_01S.htm> Click here to Turn Around </a>
        </html>

Hopefully you get the idea.  I will try to have a better explanation here
in the near future.  In the meantime, if you think this program might be
of use to you, drop me a note!
